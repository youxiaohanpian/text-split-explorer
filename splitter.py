- `chunk_size`: Max size of the resulting chunks (in either characters or tokens, as selected)
- `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between the resulting chunks (in either characters or tokens, as selected)
- `length_function`: How to measure lengths of chunks, examples are included for either characters or tokens
- The type of the text splitter, this largely controls the separators used to split on
